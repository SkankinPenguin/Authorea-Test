1. Brief introduction to the album _Bitches Brew_
2. _Pharaoh’s Dance_ example
3. _Bitches Brew_ — structured through edits
4. Some remarks on the live versions of _Bitches Brew_

But firstly I want to give some remarks on the title of my paper. Jack DeJohnette stated in a feature in German Jazz Magazine _JAZZthing & blue rhythm_ that after the sessions for the album _Bitches Brew_ — which took place at Columbia Studio B in New York City from the 19th until the 21st of August 1969 — _Teo Macero_ (who was the producer) _took the tapes and cut out the parts he did not like. He then mixed the songs and sent them to Miles to listen to them._ DeJohnette continues — and I quote: _Miles was not patient enough for this kind of work \[…]_(fn) Those statements led me to the conclusion that Teo Macero decided where and what kinds of edits were made. Thus the title “Teo’s Brew”. ::— As I was told recently that Miles wrote a letter to Teo Macero indicating the changes he wanted to have made to the material, the statement by DeJohnette was obviously misleading. This corresponds to Harvey Brooks remembering that _Miles knew what he wanted to do — he had a plan before he went into the studio. I heard him argue with Teo over where an edit should be when they were assembling the album._(fn)::

As I said in my abstract Miles Davis’s double LP _Bitches Brew_ — which was published on the 30th of March 1970 — does not only take a special position in Miles’s own discography but is said to be a starting point for the so-called “Jazz Rock” or “Fusion Jazz”. Like the previous Album _In a Silent Way_ (published one year earlier) it combines Jazz with Rock elements.
But compared to _In a Silent Way_ there were some changes regarding the musicians on _Bitches Brew_: Although most of the musicians stayed the same — namely Wayne Shorter on saxophone, Chick Corea and Joe Zawinul on piano, John McLaughlin on guitar, and Dave Holland on bass — Herbie Hancock was replaced by Larry Young on piano and Jack DeJohnette entered instead of Tony Williams on the drums. Additionally a number of musicians was added to the group: Harvey Brooks — who also played bass on Bob Dylan's _Like a Rolling Stone_ — played the electric bass, with Don Alias and Lenny White two additional drummers came in, Jumma Santos joined for percussion, and Bennie Maupin played the bass clarinet which added — to quote DeJohnette again — _the mysterious sounds_(fn).

The recording sessions for this album are said to have been three days of improvisation in the studio. Or as Harvey Brooks has pointed out — and I quote: _Miles was recording like the way we would write songs. You know, you just jam until you find something and that becomes part of the song. He would have us play and we would finish a section and he would say ‘Go on, Go on!‘ and we would keep playing._(fn) However, the edits in the studio — especially in the case of _Pharaoh’s Dance_ and _Bitches Brew_ — are obvious.

As one example I want to pick out a part of _Pharaoh’s Dance_. It starts at 8’29’’ and ends at 8’40’’.

> spectrogram 1: Pharaoh's Dance (8’27''155—9'00''887).

This phrase begins with a piano chord which is followed by a short solo motive by Miles which also includes the characteristic half tone glissando Miles used since the 1965 album _E.S.P._. Then you can hear a short piano motive which Bob Belden calls “2-beat phrase” in his remarks discussing the recording and post-production of the album in the booklet of _The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions_ (which were published in 1998). In the middle of this motive you can hear someone talking in the background. Unfortunately one cannot understand what is said, maybe it is an instruction or something similar. The small yellow markers above the waveform show where the voice can be heard. The whole phrase can be heard again some seconds later — right after those loops which Bob Belden calls “echo trumpet”. As you can see, this second phrase is an exact repetition of the first one — including the voice. At the end there are added four loops of the “2-beat phrase” — also including the voice. Since in the loops the voice is barely hearable I assume that Teo Macero tried to eliminate it.

Now for the title song of the album, _Bitches Brew_. Belden offers a brief description of the “original” and of the final  structure in his before mentioned liner notes. Since I have no access to the original tapes I have to believe him when he writes that — and I quote: _The rubato section (part 2) was assembled to a length of 6:00 from two takes. Then, for reasons unknown, the back half \[…] begins the performance._(fn) I put all edits Belden mentions in his notes into this spectrogram of the whole song:
(img)
> spectrogram 2: _Bitches Brew_.

The song starts and ends with the “back half” of the “original part 2”. In the middle of the piece the first half of this second part can be heard (14’36). The “original part 1” follows the starting “back half” (2’50) and the first half (17’20). Additionally it can be heard at about 13’28. At about 10’31 starts a two-bar phrase played by Miles I want to show closer:

> spectrogram 3: “two-bar phrase”.

As you can see this phrase is looped three times — and I quote Belden again: _to create the sensation of melody, a phrase that is organized by editing._(fn)

Four of the six songs of the album were performed live as well — namely _Bitches Brew_ itself, _Spanish Key_, _Miles Runs the Voodoo Down_, and _Sanctuary_. All of those — except _Bitches Brew_ — could be heard in performances which took place **before** the album sessions took place in August 1969.

Since of the two songs I talked about only _Bitches Brew_ was performed live I want to give some short remarks on those performances of the piece I was able to listen to — which are the bold ones on this list: 

- **04-11-1969, Tivoli, Copenhagen**
- **05-11-1969, Folkets Hus, Stockholm**
- **07-11-1969, Berliner Jazztage**
- 07-03-1970, Fillmore East
- 10-04-1970, Fillmore West
- **17-06-1970, Fillmore East**
- **18-06-1970, Fillmore East**
- **19-06-1970, Fillmore East**
- **20-06-1970, Fillmore East**
- **18-08-1970, Tanglewood, Lenox, MA**
- **29-08-1970, Isle of Wright**
- **15-10-1970, Fillmore West**
- **22-10-1971, Newport Jazz Festival in Europe, Neue Stadthalle, Dietikon, Switzerland**

Since at latest the 5th of November 1969 the live performances of _Bitches Brew_ start with the same bass notes as the recorded and edited piece — which is, if I may say this again, the “back half” of the second part of the song on the master take. The concerts in autumn 1969 were played by the Second Miles Davis Quintet — which consisted of Wayne Shorter on Saxophone, Herbie Hancock on piano, Ron Carter on bass, and Tony Williams on drums. Whereas the performance at Fillmore West on the 15th of October 1970 starts with the “groovier” part 1. Miles now plays live performances with electric instead of double bass and additional percussionists. The presumably latest live performance of this song on the 22nd of October 1971 starts with some Wah-Wah effects from Miles — he used to amplify his trumpet since around December 1970. At about 2’00 the bass of the first part enters.

Franz Kerschbaumer writes in his book _Miles Davis: Stilkritische Untersuchungen zur musikalischen Entwicklung seines Personalstils_ — which was released in 1978 as part 5 of the _Studies in Jazz Research_ — that the style Miles uses during his concerts in 1969 is very much the same as from 1965 onwards. This means the musicians played as a “classical” quintet and Free Jazz elements — which were quite common with other Jazz musicians of that time such as Ornette Coleman — did not occur at the concerts until 1970. This corresponds to my “feeling” that the later live recordings of the song _Bitches Brew_ are somewhat “funkier” than the earlier ones. And with the fact that for the concerts in the late 70s at least one additional percussionist was hired, Dave Holland on double bass was replaced by Michael Henderson on electric bass, and very often Keith Jarrett — who played the organ then — joined in too.
Jack DeJohnette — who played live shows with Miles from summer 1969 until 1970 — said in the interview mentioned before that — and I quote: _With Miles the music changed in every concert we played. He never gave instructions but lead the group through his playing._(fn)

I have to investigate further how the live performances which took place before the recording sessions in August 1969 differ from the album versions and the later live performances. _Sanctuary_ even was recorded in the studio before: at the 15th of February 1968 a first version of the song was played by the Second Miles Davis Quintet. On this recording George Benson joined the quintet for the guitar part. This early version can be found on the compilation _Circle in the Round_ which was released in November 1979 and surely needs a closer look at.
